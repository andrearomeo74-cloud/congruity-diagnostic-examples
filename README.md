# Congruity – Diagnostic Examples

This repository provides minimal, concrete diagnostic examples showing how the Congruity framework operates in real systems.

The goal is not prediction, optimization, or control.
The goal is admissibility.

Each diagnostic answers four questions:
1. What is the system?
2. What level of congruity does it operate on?
3. Where does proportionality break?
4. Which moves are admissible vs. non-admissible?

These examples are intentionally simple.
If Congruity works here, scaling is an engineering problem—not a conceptual one.

This repository is a companion to:
- congruity-periodic-table
- DNA as Congruity Memory
- disease, aging, AI, and cosmology repositories

Congruity does not predict outcomes.
It defines the space of valid moves.
